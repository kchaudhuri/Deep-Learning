CIFAR Image Classifier

In this project we built a CNN model with three convolutional layers and 2 fully connected layer to classify ten classes of objects.

Each layer is implented in the form of functions to make the network much more modular.

Preprocessing of the input images is done by normalising the image pixels and output labels are one hot encoded to fit the softmax layer.

A training accuracy of 77% is achieved on the CIFAR Image Dataset.
